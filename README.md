A single clean minimal design HTML file with inline styles. All the code should be tabbed with 2 spaces and not 4 spaces.

Create a light and dark theme as defined by the user's system without any visual button or anything to switch. The whole content is wrapped in the HTML elment `<main>` which is vertically aligned in the middle. The max width of the content to fit within `42rem` or roughly `768px` but is responsive and hence within about max `96%` of the screen width.

Use a serif font-family for the styles. Use OKLCH for the colors.
Use Smart Typography such as the curly quotes in all of the textual contents.

- First line is the Day, and the time. e.g. Fri, 7:07 PM.
- Second line is the DATE and DAY in a Big large font. e.g. Jan 1.
- Third line is the YYYY in the the same format at the first line.
- The last section is a subtle box that is an `<article>` element to define and provide more information of the date above. It has a single `h1` for the title and paragraphs for description.

A well commented code in the HTML should be the place where the user will update the date and time in International Standard Format. e.g. "2025-07-18" and "19:07" separately.
